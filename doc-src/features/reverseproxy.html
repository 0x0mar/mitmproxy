In reverse proxy mode, mitmproxy accepts standard HTTP requests and forwards
them to the specified upstream server. This is in contrast to
<a href="@!urlTo("upstreamproxy.html")!@">upstream proxy mode</a>, in which
mitmproxy forwards HTTP proxy requests to an upstream proxy server.

<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th width="20%">command-line</th> <td>-R <i>schema</i>://hostname[:port]</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Here, **schema** is one of http, https, http2https or https2http. The latter
two extended schema specifications control the use of HTTP and HTTPS on
mitmproxy and the upstream server. You can indicate that mitmproxy should use
HTTP, and the upstream server uses HTTPS like this:

	http2https://hostname:port

And you can indicate that mitmproxy should use HTTPS while the upstream
service uses HTTP like this:

	https2http://hostname:port
