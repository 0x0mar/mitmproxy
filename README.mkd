# :warning: This branch is stalled.

However, this is not bad news: Based on the experiences we gained from developing HoneyProxy, mitmproxy is currently getting a new interface rewritten from the ground up. 

This branch 

  1. doesn't include the latest fixes in the mitmproxy core and  
  2. will not be merged into mitmproxy itself.
  
Please take this into account when using it and check out if `mitmweb` already satisfies your requirements.
